# RooCodeLogs
Let's build a high quality dataset of successful Roo task completion logs to train a local model to use Roo Code!

Refer to this discussion on background and details:
https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/discussions/4465

UPDATE:
this offers a much better and more automated way to gather your task logs:
https://github.com/Jenscaasen/llm-proxy-finetune-collector

If you have tasks where Claude or another local model was able to successfully complete them using appropriate tool use (diffs, etc), you can export them as markdown files and upload them here. Subscribe to the discussion linked if you would like to be alerted, once the model is trained, evaluated, and open sourced.


This is how you export a log of messages within the task to a .md file.
